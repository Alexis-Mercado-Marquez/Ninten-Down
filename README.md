# Ninten-Down
It's a DEMO web page that I create in university with the help of other students, although i did most os it.
The site emulates a video game forum. I uses a firebase to save comments and user's information.
Almost all the functions require to create a user account first (in the "registro" section).

In the site you can write posts about video games (and even put an image on them), search for specific post or
put comments in other users posts.

The sites made use of HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript and firebase.
